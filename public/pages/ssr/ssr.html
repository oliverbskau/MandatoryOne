      When we create a folder called public, we can have different html files in
      that folder. They are static.
    </p>
    <img src="/pages/ssr/publicfolder.png" />
    <p>When we use express, we can run it with the static folder</p>
    <img src="/pages/ssr/expressstatic.png" />

    <p>
      Now we can use the public folder, as a pathway to get all the paths and
      assign them to variables. In here we can glue html files together.
    </p>

    <img src="/pages/ssr/htmlglue.png" width="770px" />

    <p>
      This means that forexample the navigation bar at the top of this page, is
      only created once, and glued to all of the html files, so the html code
      doesen't have to be repeated for every html document.
    </p>

    <p>"nav.html"</p>

    <img src="/pages/ssr/nav.png" width="770px" />

    <p>"any body .html" this is this actual page as an example</p>
    <img src="/pages/ssr/body.png" width="770px" />

    <p>"footer.html"</p>
    <img src="/pages/ssr/footer.png" width="770px" />

    <p>
      Now the pages get's connected to GET methods and the response is based on
      the glued html file.
    </p>

    <img src="/pages/ssr/getmethods.png" width="770px" />
