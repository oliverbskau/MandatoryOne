  <p>
    "Scripts" in package.json is a shortcut definer for commands you can use in
    the terminal.
  </p>
  <img src="/pages/express/package.json.png" />
  <p>
    The left side within the curlybrackets is the command. <br />
    The right side is the actual input into the terminal. <br />
    It is just like declaring a variable in js.
  </p>
  <p>If we do - "start": "nodemon.cmd app.js"</p>
  <p>
    Then i can run this website in the terminal just by typing "start" as a
    command.
  </p>
  <p>That is actually a great idea! Lets do that:</p>

  <p>
    It's about defining variables in node, so you later can access them. For
    example ( User=me node app.js )
    <br />
    process.env.User // "Me"
  </p>
  <p>I don't know how to put words into it. <br /></p>

    Routers - Redirection (Client-side vs. Server-side) (Dynamic vs. Static
    redirection in frontend)
  </h2>

  <p>Server-side redirect</p>

  <p>
    Server Side Redirects A server side redirect happens, when the HTTP request
    to a web server is answered with a server status code, which indicates the
    requested document has moved to another URL. <br />
    The client will then request the destination URL and the user gets
    forwarded. <br />
    There are several kinds of HTTP status codes (RFC 7231) that indicate a
    redirect of a certain type. <br />
    There are no good or bad redirect status codes. <br />
    Each kind of redirect has a purpose and can be applied with positive
    effects. If a search engine discovers a redirect, it has to decide how to
    handle it. <br />
    From a SEO perspective, there is one central question: Should link juice or
    ranking signals be passed via the redirect? To make this decision, search
    engines look at the status code used for the redirect and its technical
    details.<br />
    The following table shows the 30x status codes and their technical details
    relevant in this context.
  </p>

  <p>client-side redirect</p>

  <p>
    A client side redirect is a direct forward to a destination URL. <br />
    The client side redirect is induced by the client, e.g. browser, directly.
    While server side redirects are the desirable way to implement redirects,
    authors don't always have the opportunity to control server side redirects.
    For this case, client side redirects can be a choice to forward a user or
    have a document refreshed.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">CORS problems</h2>
  <p>What is a CORS problem in Javascript?</p>

  <p>
    If the CORS configuration isn't setup correctly, the browser console will
    present an error like "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy
    disallows reading the remote resource at $somesite" indicating that the
    request was blocked due to violating the CORS security rules.
  </p>

  <p>How to solve the problems</p>
  <p>
    For example, if you want to solve this on the express. js then all you have
    to do is use a certain middleware that will handle the origin key. But, for
    any non-standard HTTP request like PUT, PATCH, DELETE, you'll have to
    preflight them.
