  <h2 class="topicHeader">Intro to Node.js</h2>
  <p>
    Node.js is an opensource, cross-platform, backend javascript runtime
    environment. It executes javascript code outside a webbrowser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
    server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web
    page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of having different languages for writing backend and frontend,
    server-side and client-side scripts. Node.js provides possibilities of
    creating a fullstack program in one language.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Commands in terminal</h2>
  <p>
    When we downloaded Visual Studio Code, we somehow needed to know how to run
    scripts. <br /><br />
    Therefore were we introduced to these commands:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>Short explenation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>cd</td>
      <td>Change Directory</td>
      <td>Navigates through paths</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ls</td>
      <td>list</td>
      <td>lists items in directory of current path</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>New-Item</td>
      <td>New Item</td>
      <td>Creates a new item using filename.format</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Node</td>
      <td>Node</td>
      <td>Uses the node environment to run application</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    We got some excersises regarding Objects, Arrays and String. To hand-in
    progress we needed to know some commands used for github.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Short explenation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>git commit -m "message"</td>
      <td>commits new changes to github</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>git add -A</td>
      <td>add's all committed files, ready to be pushed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>git push</td>
      <td>pushes committed files to git repository</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>git pull</td>
      <td>fetches all files from git repository</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<div class="topicDiv">
  <h2 class="topicHeader">Variables</h2>
  <p>Variables are containers for storing data (a value)</p>
  <p>There are 4 ways to use variables</p>
  <p>let, var, const, "nothing"</p>
  <p>
    We only use var in older browsers, since it was the first value container
    integrated in javascript. let and const are newer and doesn't work in old
    browsers.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">REST API Conventions</h2>
  <p>
    We needed to learn about some simple conventions of REST API's and how to
    name endpoints and what they are used for. This is an example of CRUD <br> 
    ( Create Read Update Delete ), on an object "Meme".
