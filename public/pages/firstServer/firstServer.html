  <h2 class="topicHeader">Callback functions</h2>

  <p>What is a callback function?</p>
  <p>
    A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another
    function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any
    function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be
    executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
  </p>
  <p>Why callback functions?</p>
  <p>
    We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous,
    which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running
    until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will
    execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the function runs through an entire array before the new
    values are assigned to the new array.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Clean code / Code conventions</h2>
  <p>
    To get "prettier" code, and to simply follow some simple code conventions,
    we installed "Prettier - Code formatter". When the code is saved, the format
    is changed so it becomes more nice and structured to look at.
  </p>
  <p>Other examples:</p>
  <p>
    Variables: lowercase first letter, otherwise camelcase - let
    pointScoreTableAmount <br />
    Constants: All uppercase - const PI
  </p>

  <p>
    Clean code and code conventions are important, so that develpors worldwide
    understand eachothers code. It is easier when we work together on the same
    code, since we have the same set of rules when we write a function.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Package.json</h2>

  <p>What is packacge.json ?</p>

  <p>
    All npm packages contain a file, usually in the project root, called
    package.json - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project.
    Here we can declaire a lot of things such as dependensies or even "command
    shortcuts" to be used in the terminal.
  </p>

  <p>What does it do?</p>

  <p>
    It records important metadata about a project which is required before
    publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that
    npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point
    to our package.
