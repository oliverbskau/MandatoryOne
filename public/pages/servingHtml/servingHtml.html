  <p>What is a loop?</p>
  <p>
    A loop is a function that runs or iterates through something. Either
    variables, but in most cases arrays.
  </p>

  <p>Here we have an array:</p>

  <p>So how do we iterate it?</p>
  <p>
    We do NOT use forloops in javascript!<br />
    This will work, but is not a great solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    For loops are: <br />
    overly verbose <br />
    error prone <br />
    not functional
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead we use some of javascript's already inbuild functions, that iterates
    just as good and even better

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Nodemon</h2>

  <p>WHen do we use nodemon?</p>

  <p>
    Nodemon is a smart tool, when creating code. For every change in your
    script, it saves the script, stops the program and then reruns the program.
    It makes the work progress very smooth and intuitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forexample when you create a website, you don't have to go to the terminal
    each and every time when you make a change to your program. So simple hands
    on testing, is a much quicker process.

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Sending Data</h2>

  <p>
    When creating a website, we use endpoints in url adress to define what page
    we want to go to. When the endpoint is triggered, it calls a method that we
    have created. Within that method, we send a respone which calls the html
    file that matches the endpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forexample is the method and endpoint for this page demonstrated as the code
    below:

  <h2 class="topicHeader">Pure Data CRUDable REST API</h2>

  <p>We learned and touched upon how to implement API's from other websites:</p>

  <p>Then we need to send respons on endpoint:</p>
